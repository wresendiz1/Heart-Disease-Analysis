# Heart-Disease-Analysis
- Project focused on analyzing a heart disease dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dataset consisted of a large sample size with detailed clinical and demographic variables, including age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and lifestyle choices like smoking and education. Our goal was to identify the features that had the greatest impact on determining whether a patient had a stroke. Analyzing heart disease data is crucial due to its prevalence as a leading cause of death worldwide, its impact on quality of life, and its association with other health conditions.
